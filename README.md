American Gods Volume 2: My Ainsel (Graphic Novel) by Neil Gaiman,P. Craig Russell,Scott Hampton Book Review

Name: Ryan Mease
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: Excellent Visual Presentation of the Novel
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2021
Review: I was really looking forward to this volume because of how much of it takes place in Wisconsin, my home state. I delighted in seeing how Lakeside was depicted in the comic and found this volume very nostalgic to read. In many ways this is slowest of the three volumes in the series because it's centered on the character development of Shadow and the humans, with fewer appearances from the Gods and fewer novel Gods (old or new).

The insert with stories like the diaspora of the African Gods among the enslaved populations in the US and Haiti is written in a way that's both timely and thoughtful, likely updated from the original novel to match the current state of race consciousness in American society. The entire series has proven itself deft at weaving race into the context of the novel without leaning too heavily on formulaic recitations of antiracist dogma. The book is antiracist in a quiet and authentic way.

Title: Loved it
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 2, 2022
Review: Loved the novel but terrible packing. Why is there no air bubble packing in the box? Both of my copies have all four corners damaged cause of this.

Besides that the novel was a great read!

Review: American Gods is one of Gaiman's best. I read few chapters of this on Darkhorse comics. It was beautifully done.
If you are a fan of American Gods, this will make a great addition to your library!

Title: Gorgeous book!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on May 3, 2019
Review: I loved the 1st volume & waited in eager anticipation of this one. It‚Äôs just as beautiful. I love this story, having listened to the (very well done) audiobook & I am enjoying the Starz show. I can‚Äôt wait to snag the last volume.

Title: Hardcover is a plus!
Date: Reviewed in the United States on June 11, 2019
Review: I was pleasantly surprised to see that this was hardcover. I purchased it so I could read ahead from the series and didn‚Äôt realize. The illustrations are crisp and definitely something I could read over and over.
